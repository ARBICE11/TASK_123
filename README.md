Firstly, I used the drop-down menu to filter the **Job type** by unticking the rest and ticking the **_freelance_** only. I then proceeded to the **Home** ribbon and I clicked on the **Conditional Formating**. I then clicked on the **Highlight cell rules**, then I selected **Greater than** function which allowed me to input **$10000**; this retained employees whose earnings/remunerations were greater than $10000.
